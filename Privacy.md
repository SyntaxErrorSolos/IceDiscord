Without "Message Content", Automoderation & counter won't be possible. Without MessageID's, RoleID's and ChannelID's Tickets system and Reaction role won't be possible. We will *not* start to store the data *until* you have ran the commands. Example, We will not store MessageID *until* you've created a reaction role or tickets system for your Guild

Are all IDs that anyone on Discord can access, they provide no real value to any indiviual or company.

Message Content however, can be of value to an indiviual. As stated in the "Why", we only use your message content for AutoModeration & counter. Automoderation is not stored in our database, Counting is. Counting stores the current count number for a specific Guild. Nothing else.

> Guild Invites

Guild invites are not stored in our database.

> Error Logs
They *normally* do not contain any sensitive information and are only available to the Developers of Ice

### Data Deletion 

All Data collected by Ice can be deleted with the use of a few commands. (This does *not* include `Error Logs`)!
